# Helpful tips:

* Atom uses a TextMate type grammar. While TextMate uses plist's(XMLish),
  Atom stores them in [CSON][CSON] format.

* Atom uses the [Oniguruma][Oniguruma] which is the same one that Ruby uses.
* A helpful site to try out Ruby regex is [Rubular][Rubular].
* [Regex101](regex101.com) is more graphical and nicer also useful but make
  sure to test out the regex on [Rubular][Rubular] once you have it assembled!

# Extended info:

* The code that Atom uses to actually process the grammars is called
  [first-mate][first-mate].
