# Atom Perl 6 Support - Fun Edition!

[![apm package][apm-ver-link]][releases]

A more colorful, thoughtful, and helpful language grammar for Perl 6. Derived from the builtin [language-perl](https://github.com/atom/language-perl) package but with many bugfixes and additions.  You might ask why I didn't just add a PR there but I feel that this package adds quite a bit more that it might not be everyone's cup of tea. However, I do plan on adding support for autocomplete+, linter, atom-build, and atom-runner.  Maybe even integrating a perl6 REPL would be fun!

> You will need to either disable the builtin `language-perl` package or select `Perl 6 FE` manually.  I am looking for a better solution.

## What's Makes This The Fun Edition™?

> Perl 6 is *optimized for fun* -Audrey Tang

* This package was developed to work with [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) ligatures

* More syntax highlighted (numbers, operators, interpolation, traits, better strings)

* This package will also soon contain support for many popular atom packages that have service hooks like autocomplete+ and linter

* I'd like to add a builtin REPL eventually

Here's a few more examples:
